# Bike-Sharing Usage Analysis

This repository contains a single code file from a group project that analyzed bike-sharing usage patterns in Seoul. Unfortunately, we didn't organize the project on GitHub during its progress, so this repository only includes the final version of the code.

### üìÖ Project Duration
- **1 Month**

### üìå Problem Statement
- Growing popularity of Seoul's public bike-sharing system, "Ttareungyi."
- Existing studies focused on general bicycle environments, lacking a tailored analysis of Ttareungyi-specific factors.

### üîç Research Content
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
   - Combined data on bike rental station locations with rental history data.
   - Excluded trips with 0m travel distance and trips below the average travel distance (2.08 km).
   
2. **Most Frequently Used Routes**
   - Identified the most common combinations of rental and return locations.
   - Removed trips where rental and return locations were the same before recalculating the most frequent combinations.
   
3. **Affinity Scoring**
   - Created a scoring system using key variables such as slope, illegal parking rate, and bicycle lane coverage.

### üìä Research Findings
- **Distribution of Rental Stations (2022)**  
  Visualization of all bike rental stations across Seoul.

- **Highest Usage for Unique Routes**  
  Excluding same-location rentals and returns, high usage was observed in areas with greenery or near waterfronts.

### üåü Conclusion
- **Optimal placement of bike rental stations** can significantly improve usage rates.
- Limitations include not incorporating variable importance and weights, requiring **further research**.
